# Content Placement Guidelines

## Quick Decision Rule

"Would I share this with a prospective client evaluating Lokahi?"
- **YES** → Post on Lokahi (www.lokahi.me)
- **NO** → Post on Bitterness Inc. (blog.pokarov.com)

## Lokahi - Professional Blog

**POST HERE:**
- Strategic frameworks and insights
- Industry analysis and trends
- Advisory perspectives
- Case studies
- Professional thought leadership
- Client-facing content

**VOICE:** Professional but authentic. Polished Yariv.

## Bitterness Inc. - Personal Blog

**POST HERE:**
- Cultural commentary
- Personal opinions and hot takes
- Book reviews
- Essays on life, philosophy, society
- Controversial content
- Anything you wouldn't send a client

**VOICE:** Full personality. Unfiltered.

## Gray Areas

- **Tech trends** → Professional if advisory-focused, personal if opinion
- **Israel/regional** → Personal unless work-related
- **Books/learning** → Personal unless extracting professional insights
